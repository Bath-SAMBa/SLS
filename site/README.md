How to get this set up on GitHub Pages, and subsequently edit it:

1.  Choose a student who has R-Studio downloaded.
2.  Push the attached repository to the student's GitHub.
3.  Go to github.com and configure GitHub pages to build the site from the "docs" folder.
4.  Download Quarto from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
5.  Open the "website.Rproj" file in R-Studio. Edit the "sls.qmd" file (this is the SLS schedule) as appropriate. In R-studio this is very easy: it's an intuitive GUI
6.  Render the website, all outputted html and css is shoved into the "website/docs" folder. There is a button for this in R-studio: top right\
    window got to the build tab, click "Render Website". Pressing this button will also open a preview of the website.
7.  Push the freshly rendered website to GitHub. Should update within an hour.
